# 🚀 Web3 Smart Contract Project

## 🧩 Project Description
This project demonstrates a **basic Web3 smart contract** setup, showcasing how blockchain-based logic can be deployed and interacted with seamlessly.  
It serves as a great starting point for beginners who want to learn how smart contracts work, get familiar with Solidity, and understand the deployment process on blockchain networks.

## 💡 What It Does
The project includes a **Solidity smart contract** that interacts with the blockchain to perform essential functions such as reading, writing, and managing decentralized data.  
You can connect this contract to a frontend (like React or Next.js) using libraries such as **Ethers.js** or **Web3.js** to create a complete DApp experience.

## 🌟 Features
- ✅ Simple and clean Solidity smart contract structure  
- ⚙️ Easy to deploy and interact with on testnets (e.g., Sepolia, Polygon, BSC Testnet)  
- 💬 Beginner-friendly code comments for learning purposes  
- 🔗 Ready for frontend integration using MetaMask or WalletConnect  
- 🧱 Extendable for advanced blockchain functionalities  

## 🔗 Deployed Smart Contract
- Language: Solidity ^0.8.20
- Framework: Remix
- Network: Celo Sepolia Testnet
- Contract Address: 0x7675B865D7dB57d6441Cb23E41c022Bab832D61E

## 🧩 Future Enhancements
- 🖥️ Build a React front-end with Celo Composer or Ethers.js
- 🧾 Add voter registration and candidate management
- 📊 Display live voting stats on UI
- 🔐 Integrate identity verification (optional)

## 🙌 Acknowledgments
- Celo Blockchain for providing eco-friendly infrastructure
- Remix IDE for easy smart contract testing
- Blockscout for transparent transaction viewing

💡 Pro Tip: Start small — experiment, break things, and learn how decentralized apps work under the hood.

## 💻 Smart Contract Code

pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract DecentralizedSmartBank {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    event Deposit(address indexed user, uint256 amount);
    event Withdrawal(address indexed user, uint256 amount);

    function deposit() external payable {
        require(msg.value > 0, "Deposit amount must be greater than zero");
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;

        emit Deposit(msg.sender, msg.value);
    }

    function withdraw(uint256 amount) external {
        require(amount > 0, "Withdraw amount must be greater than zero");
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");

        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);

        emit Withdrawal(msg.sender, amount);
    }

    function totalBankBalance() external view returns (uint256) {
        return address(this).balance;
    }
}
